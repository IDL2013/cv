aboutme: "Dynamic modeller and data scientist focussing on infectious disease dynamics, epidemiology, and control. I have a strong interest in reproducibility and tool development, having developed multiple widely used packages and dashboards. My work lies at the interface between dynamic modelling, statistical modelling and data science - incorporating elements from software development to enhance robustness and longevity."
